This directory contains enough mock python modules to make it through
most of a weasel installation.  The classes in the modules are pretty
trivial, they construct objects from a dictionary and only provide a
few methods for querying fields.  The dictionaries used to initialize
are stored in a module named fauxconfig in a "configuration"
directory, for example, test/good-config.1 .  The configuration
directory acts as a fake root directory for fauxroot and through
fauxconfig contains the canned responses for any mock objects.  So,
good-config.1 contains a simple configuration that weasel should be
able to operate on without errors.  Whereas a bad configuration
directory might set things up so an install should error out.
