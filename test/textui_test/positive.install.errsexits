capability to boot up ESX or ESXi. The installation of the Software can be
on an internal or external dedicated disk, a Fibre Channel or iSCSI LUN, an
NFS or SMB share, a USB key, PXE server, firmware, or any other bootable
media.  If a Server has connectivity to a bootable media containing ESX or
ESXi, even if it also has the capability of booting non-ESX or non-ESXi
server images, it shall be considered an Installed Server for the purposes

VMware grants you a nonexclusive, non-transferable license, without rights

Software and each Licensed Additional Module on a single Server, unless
permitted to have multiple instances on a single Server or to have multiple
instances on multiple Servers by the payment of applicable license fees
(whether such fees are based on a per Processor, a per Virtual Machine, a
per user or any other VMware approved licensing model); (ii) use the
Software and each Licensed Additional Module solely for information
processing and computing purposes, including the hosting of computer
application-based services from a Virtual Machine and provisioning of such
services via an internal or external network for third parties, provided
such services do not allow the third parties to install, upload, or
uninstall computer application(s) to and from the Virtual Machine(s); and
(iii) use and reproduce the VMware vSphere Client Software or VMware
vSphere WebAccess (in object code form only) for the purposes of
installation and operation on an unlimited number of your own internal
computers or terminals solely for the purpose of accessing the Server on
which the Software is installed.

each instance of the Software on any Installed Server regardless of its
power state or purpose.  For clarification, this includes any and all
Servers that may only be temporarily installed with the Software for
disaster recovery readiness testing, in the case of an actual disaster or
data center migration. Copies of the Software boot media that are made for
backup or disaster recovery purposes do not require separate licenses so
long as they are not associated with a Server in a way that allows that
Server to boot ESX or ESXi from that image; however when such a bootable
association is made, said Server constitutes an Installed Server which
would require a valid license for the Software.
<BLANKLINE>
Blade server license limitation.  You may license this software package as
part of a license pack or bundle (a "Blade Server License Pack") for
installation and operation on a Blade Server.  If you acquired the Software
as part of a Blade Server License Pack, you may only install and operate
the Server Software on a Blade Server and you may not transfer, install or
use the Server Software on Servers in a rack-mounted server configuration
or on any other Servers.  In addition, a Blade Server License Pack must be
